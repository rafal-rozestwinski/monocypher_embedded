# monocypher_embedded

Stripped down version of excelent Monocypher crypto library (https://github.com/LoupVaillant/Monocypher), for embedded usage (tested on STM32F1, STM32F4, ESP8266 and ESP32 chips).

## Why?

Needed for transparent LoRa+Mavlink2 packets encryption for my airplane and boat drone projects.
